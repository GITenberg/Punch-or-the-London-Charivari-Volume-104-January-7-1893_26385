<p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Elysian Fields, a flower-gemmed bank, by a flowing stream,
beneath the sylvan shade of unfading foliage.</i><br />
Mr. <span class="sc">Punch</span>&mdash;<i>who is free
of all places, from Fleet Street to Parnassus&mdash;discovered, in Arcadian
attire, attempting "numerous verse" on a subject of National
importance&mdash;to wit, the approaching Royal Marriage.</i></p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Mr. Punch.</i> Propt on this "bank of amaranth and moly,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Beneath the shade of boughs <i>un</i>melancholy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I meditate on &AElig;stas and on Hymen!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Pheugh! <i>What</i> a Summer! Torrid drought doth try men,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And fields and farms; yet when our Royal <span class="sc">May</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Weds&mdash;in July&mdash;'tis fit that Phoebus stay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">His fiery car to welcome her! By Jove,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">That sounds Spenserian! Illustrious Love</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Epithalamion demands, and lo!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">We've no official Laureate, to let flow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With Tennysonian dignity and sweetness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Courtly congratulation. <span class="sc">Dryden</span>'s neatness,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Even the gush of <span class="sc">Nahum Tate</span> or <span class="sc">Pye</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Are not available, so <span class="sc">Punch</span> must try</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">His unofficial pen. My tablets, <span class="sc">Toby</span>!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">This heat's enough to give you hydrophoby!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Talk about Dog-days! Is that nectar iced?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Then just one gulp! It beats the highest priced</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And creamiest champagne. Now, silence, Dog,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And let me give my lagging Muse a jog!</span><br /><br />

<div class="direction">[<i>Writes, with one eye on the portraits of the</i> Duke of <span class="sc">York</span> <i>and</i>

<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">His labour of most loyal love, discreetly.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Compliments delicate, piled not sickly-sweetly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like washy <span class="sc">Warton</span>'s, nor so loud thrasonical&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Like Glorious <span class="sc">John</span>'s&mdash;that they sound half ironical!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'Tis hard indeed for loyal love to hit</span><br />

Crismus-Heve supper, as ushal, and henjoyed owrselves till a rayther
latish hour, as ushal. Upon cumpareing notes, we didn't find as we had
werry much to complane about, the grand and nobel old wirtue of
horsepitality perwailing much as ushal.</p>

<p>Howsumdever, upon cumparin notes a second time as to the most poplar
subjecks of conwersashun at the warious Eleckshun Dinners, on Saint
Tommas' Day, or the day when the hole of the Common Counselmen has to go
to their Constittuents for to be elected&mdash;though what St. Tommas ewer
had to do with it I never could dishcover, no more can <span class="sc">Brown</span>&mdash;we found
as they was amost all on 'em a torkin about sum grate change, as a lot
of outsiders called County Counsellors was a going for to try to get
made; the werry principellist being, <span class="sc">Brown</span> said, that they might have
occashonal use of the Manshun Ouse, and so give grand Dinners to the
West-End Swells, and so get them to wote for their having jolly hansum
allowences with which to pay for 'em! But quiet ole <span class="sc">Joe</span>, who's one of
them rum fellers as don't say much, but thinks a deal, says, in his
quiet way, as how as it's werry much wus than that, for, from what a
werry ancient Deputty said, as he was a helping him to his jugged air,
he had werry little dowt but that County Counsellors was acshally a
going in for erbollishing the hold Copperashun altogether! if they can
git the Goverment to be fools enuff for to promise to 'elp 'em. And
then, from what he heard from others, they are a going to rob the nobel
and Charytable Liwery Companys of all the money as they spends so nobly;
and then, not contented with that, they are a going for to ask Parlyment
to give them the command of all the sixteen thowsand Policemen as there
is in the hole of London; and then, not content with that, they are a
going for to erbolish all the eight Water Companys, and manage it all
theirselves; and then, not content with that, they are a going to take
all the Meet Markets, and the Fish Markets, includin Ancient
Billingsgate, and the Fruit and Wegeral Markets; and then, just to fill
up sum of their lezzur time, they are a going to erbolish the Thames
Conserwaters, and manage the River theirselves; and then, as they think
as them little trifles ain't quite enuff for 'em, they are a going to
arsk to be aloud to take charge of all the Docks and Wharfs on the
River! And then, as they will naterally want plenty of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> emusement after
their ard work, they arsks to be aloud to take over the control of All
the London Theaters!</p>

<p>I had a chat the other day with one of the <span class="sc">Lord Mare</span>'s Footmen, as I
allers likes to go to the werry hiest orthorities, and he finished by
saying, most emfatically,&mdash;"Mr. <span class="sc">Robert</span>, I arsks you this simple
quesshun&mdash;If it takes about two hunderd and thirty gents to keep the
grand old Citty in the bootiful condishun as it allus is, and to keep us
all in the helthy condishun as we allus is, and with the remarkabel fine
happytites as we allus has, its size being ony one square mile, and our
number ony about fifty thowsand sleepers, and about ten times as many,
as cums ewery day to hearn their living, how is it possibel for a much
smaller number of Gents, with werry littel hexperiens, to do the same
with a plaice about a hunderd and twenty times as big, and with about
five millions of peepel in it? And you may trust what I says, for I had
it from our Chapling."</p>

<p>"Why," I says, boldly, "I says at once as I don't beleeve as it's

<h2>AT ANCIENT DRURY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 30%;">
<a href="images/illus-004a.png">
<img src="images/illus-004a.png" width="100%" alt="actor and  actress" /></a>
</div>

<p><span class="sc">Druriolanus Magnificus</span> has given us something gorgeous this year in "The
Hall of a Million Mirrors," the tenth Scene of his Pantomime entitled
<i>Little Bo-Peep, Little Red Riding Hood, and Hop o' My Thumb</i>, who are
three very small people,&mdash;"small by degrees and beautifully less"&mdash;to
make so big a Show. In the Hall of Mirrors appear all the well-known
representatives of ancient Nursery Rhymes, and all the heroes and
heroines of the universally familiar Fairy Stories. Down the Palace
stairs they come, group after group, until the Stage, even of Old Drury,
can hold no more, and there is scarcely room for them all to move, much
less to indulge in any "kicking up ahind and afore," as was the wont of
the Ancient <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, whose fame is hymned in Nigger Minstrelsy. A most
brilliant scene, never to be forgotten!&mdash;that is, until next Pantomime
Season, when Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> will, in all probability, show us something
equally magnificent, and as perfect in design and colour.</p>

<p>There is such a galaxy of talent, specially of Music-hall talent, with
the two <span class="sc">Maries</span>, <span class="sc">Loftus</span> and <span class="sc">Lloyd</span>, the <span class="sc">Campbell</span> of that ilk, comical <span class="sc">Dan
Leno</span> (who looks so comically Thin O), and the amusing Brothers
<span class="sc">Griffiths</span>, but without the donkey, and with no quadruped to equal him,
though they do make beasts of themselves by appearing as wolves, who
will not be kept from the door of <i>Granny Green</i>, Mr. <span class="sc">John D'Auban</span>,
utterly unrecognisable. Besides these is a Variety Show of other Stars,
including ever-graceful <span class="sc">Emma D'Auban</span>, and Miss <span class="sc">Mabel Love</span>, of the
"skirts-so movement," both rightly reckoned in the programme as among
"the Immortals." Only one fault can be found with the Pantomime, and
that is, that there are too many brilliant Stars in it. They can't all
of them, each and severally, get an opportunity of showing how he or she
can shine in his or her own particular bright way; and so it happens
that the earliest scenes, which are less crowded, are the best for fun,
though in the latter, and specially in the one just preceding the
transformation, there is some capital comic business, and "<span class="sc">Little Tich</span>"
is at his best in his burlesque of the Skirt Dance. We wonder that this
clever diminutive person has never appeared as "<i>the</i> Claimant <i>par
excellence</i>." But perhaps his name is not "<span class="sc">Tich</span>" at all, and so, on his
first appearance on the world's stage, he was not a "<i>Tich-born</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>Extravaganza</i> portion of the Pantomime&mdash;formerly styled the
"Opening"&mdash;gave us great pleasure, and the two "Comic Scenes"&mdash;(what are
all the preceding ones? Are <span class="sc">Campbell</span>, <span class="sc">Leno</span>, <span class="sc">Williams</span>, and "<span class="sc">Little Tich</span>,"
all tragedians?)&mdash;gave us Great <span class="sc">Payne</span>&mdash;yclept <span class="sc">Harry Payne</span>, the good old
Conservative "<span class="sc">Joey</span>."</p>

<p>If the possibilities, "<i>per variation et mutation</i>" of gorgeous modern
Pantomime, are exhausted&mdash;"which," as <span class="sc">Euclid</span> observes, "is
impossible"&mdash;except we may "add a rider" (as the Clown in the Circle
might observe) that Pantomime is, in itself, a <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i>&mdash;then, perchance, Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus Magnificus</span> may give us next
Christmas a Shorter Opening, say ten Scenes, to be followed by six
Harlequinade Scenes, treating, by way of "Review," all the leading
topics of Ninety-Three. <i>Nous verrons</i>&mdash;at least, such is our hope. And
so a Prosperous New Year to Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>, and all his works.</p>

<p><i>Enterprising Publisher.</i> Yes, my dear Sir, I think, if you pay all the
expenses, we can see our way to giving <i>An Oppressed Ophelia</i> a chance.</p>

<p><i>Amateur Author.</i> You would not take a small risk?</p>

<p><i>Ent. Publisher.</i> Why no, my dear Sir. I do not see how <i>An Oppressed
Ophelia</i> can be made a safe investment without your entire assistance.
Possibly we may treat about your next novel, which I understand you to
say is called <i>An English Hamlet</i>, on other terms. In the meanwhile, let
us hope that <i>An Oppressed Ophelia</i> will be successful.</p>

dead failure?</p>

<p><i>Publisher (more cheerfully).</i> Yes, my dear Sir, but do not be
distressed. Thanks to my foresight, and your acquiescence in a
business-like arrangement, my firm has lost nothing by the transaction.</p>

<p><i>Author (dryly).</i> That I can readily understand! Well, I suppose you
have plenty of copies you can give back to me?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Well, scarcely. You see the Londoners did not take up your
book very warmly; but we have made an arrangement to dispose of the rest
of the issue in the country at a considerable reduction.</p>

<p>If my memory serves me faithfully, the above heading is a quotation from
the first verse of "<i>The British Grenadiers</i>," and is peculiarly
applicable just now to the Lessee of the St. James's Theatre, Mr. <span class="sc">George
Alexander</span>, who has got a decided success in the original Comedy, written
by Mr. <span class="sc">R. C. Carton</span>, entitled <i>Liberty Hall</i>, an excellent and a
catching name, that perhaps might have been better bestowed on a larger
picture. To play with "reserved force" until the passionate moment
arrives, is all that Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span> has to do; but this he does
admirably, never under-acting, never over-acting, always as natural as a
quiet gentleman, of a peculiarly romantic turn of mind, yet with a keen
but chastened appreciation of a practical joke, kept all to himself for
five months, should be.</p>

<p>Had he been compelled by circumstances to sustain the <i>alias</i>, and to continue playing the part of a <i>Burchell</i> in
<span class="sc">Goldsmith</span>'s <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i> for one month longer, could he have
done it? However, as the piece has "caught on," it may be that Mr.
<span class="sc">Alexander</span> will have to play the part of <i>Mr. Burchell alias Owen</i> for
even longer than half a year; and, as he selected the piece, and as he
plays this part excellently, it is mainly Owin' to <span class="sc">Alexander</span> that the
piece is payin.' Mr. <span class="sc">Ben Webster</span> is good as the somewhat
gentlemanly-caddish mixture called <i>The Hon. Gould Harringay</i>. Mr.
<span class="sc">Nutcombe Gould</span>, as a Family Solicitor, deeply interests everybody in the
First Act; "and then," like <i>Macbeth's</i> "poor player,"&mdash;which Mr. N. G.
isn't, far from it,&mdash;"is heard no more." Perhaps, during the Pantomime
season, he might re-appear at the finish with a slight addition to his
head-gear, as intimated in this little sketch of him, when he could
observe confidentially to the audience, "Here we are again!" But this is
only a hint, to the practical use of which, Mr. <span class="sc">Gould</span>, by the kind
permission of Mr. <span class="sc">Alexander</span>, is heartily welcome.</p>

<p>Capital is Miss <span class="sc">Fanny Coleman</span> as the housekeeper and maid-of-all-work;
and, in the small part of <i>Todman's</i> shop-boy, Master <span class="sc">Richard Saker</span>
shows that, as <i>Mr. Wardle</i> said of <i>Mr. Tupman</i>, when he brought down
the birds with his eyes shut, he is "an older hand at this than we
thought for." If he works at his profession, he will show himself "a
wise-<span class="sc">Saker</span>." Mr. <span class="sc">Holles</span> and Miss <span class="sc">Ailsa Craig</span>, in two very small but
strongly-marked character-parts, add to the general efficiency of an
exceptionally complete cast. Miss <span class="sc">Maude Millett</span> makes the indiscreet
<i>Amy Chilworth</i> a very sweet person, but it is Miss <span class="sc">Marion Terry</span> who has
in her hands the one strong dramatic situation at the end of the Third
Act. It is a situation which, no matter what might have been the
author's conception of it, depends for its effect solely and only on the
actress; and Miss <span class="sc">Marion Terry</span>, as she sits, rises to the occasion. It
is long since Mr. <span class="sc">Righton</span> has had such a part as that of <i>Todman</i>, the
quaint little old-fashioned bookshop-keeper, and to this quite
Dickensian character, the actor does thorough justice; as also does Mr.
<span class="sc">H. Vincent</span> to the somewhat highly coloured blusterous part of

<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<h4>No. III.&mdash;PANAMA.</h4>

<div class="direction"><span class="sc">Scene</span>, <i>and persons as before&mdash;namely, two</i> Well-informed Men, <i>an</i>
Inquirer, <i>and an</i> Average Man, <i>travelling up together in a
suburban morning-train to London.</i></div>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man.</i> Jolly old mess they seem to have got into in
Paris over this Panama business. I see they arrested half-a-dozen more
of them yesterday.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Yes&mdash;and they haven't done yet. I knew, months and
months ago, the crash must come. That French chap, <span class="sc">Lampion</span> told me all
about it. He says it'll bust up the Republic before they've done with
it.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> And a good thing too. That kind of corruption only
flourishes under a Republican form of government. They want a strong man
in France, that's what they want.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> I don't believe much in your strong men. I suppose the
last Emperor was a pretty fair specimen; but they seem to have had some
high old ramps under him, too. Besides, look at Russia.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> You can't bring Russia forward as an example.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Of course not. Russia don't count.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> Why not? I don't suppose you can make a man much stronger than
the <span class="sc">Czar</span>; but, if we're to believe what we're told, the whole place is
honeycombed with corruption. Why&mdash;(<i>to</i> First W. I. M.)&mdash;you were saying
yourself, only the other day, that Russia was corrupt to the core.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, but I was speaking of something quite different.
Russia is a country <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I thought Russia was an Autocracy.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's the same thing.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Well, anyhow, we in England haven't
done anything of the kind. You can't deny that.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> No, we haven't done anything quite on the same scale lately, I
admit that. But we've done our best with worthless mines, and bogus
Companies of all kinds, and financial papers, and Building Societies.
Seems to me we've no right to chuck stones at poor old <span class="sc">Lesseps</span>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Is that the same old chap who did something in Egypt some
years ago?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>smiling, and superior</i>). Yes, the very same. He made
the Suez Canal.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course&mdash;so he did. That was what we went to the Soudan
for, wasn't it?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Well, it had something to do with it,
of course. As we'd got four million pounds' worth of shares in the
Canal, we couldn't afford to see it upset. And then (<i>brightening</i>)
there was the Dual Control. That was really at the bottom of the whole
business.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> The Dual Control? I don't remember what that was.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why, don't you remember <span class="sc">Arabi</span> setting himself up
against the <span class="sc">Khedive</span>? Well, naturally, we couldn't stand the two of them
playing their games there; so we just had to nip in, and smash old
<span class="sc">Arabi</span>.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course, I remember the whole business now; Khartoum, and
the <span class="sc">Mahdi</span>, and all the rest of it. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>returning to the charge</i>). I wonder why they called it the
Panama Canal?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why shouldn't they? It happens to be its name.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Yes, I know that's its name now. But why call it after a
straw hat?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>amazed</i>). After a <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> After a straw hat.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>calmly, but firmly</i>). It isn't called after a straw
hat. The straw hat's called after it. That's all.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>dogged, and unconvinced</i>). Well, anyhow, I know I bought a
Panama hat last summer&mdash;and deuced expensive it was, too.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear boy, it was made in Panama. Panama's a place.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Well, I'm dashed! I never knew that. But what on earth do
they want a Canal there for?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, well, I'm bound to admit it would be a convenience.
Just think how it would shorten the sea-route. Instead of having to go
all the way round Cape What's-his-name&mdash;what <i>is</i> that blessed Cape's
name?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>tentatively</i>). Cape of Good Hope?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No, no&mdash;they're building the Nicaragua Canal for that.
Cape&mdash;Cape&mdash;why, dash it, I shall be forgetting my own name next!</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>brilliantly</i>). Capricorn.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Yes, that's it! Well, instead of having to go all round
Cape Ricorn, all we've got to do is to sail to Panama, and&mdash;(<i>impotently
concluding</i>)&mdash;there we are!</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Ah, but I don't think they'll ever finish it.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I'm not so sure about that; but, of course, the French
couldn't do it.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Of course not.</p>

allowance for them. By the Statute under whose provisions both of us are
here, I notice that I have the power to sentence you to seven years'

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>startled</i>). Seven years! But you ain't going to do it?</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> My dear friend, I will do nothing that is unjust.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner</i> (<i>angrily</i>). You'd better not, or you'll 'ear of it again!</p>

<p><i>Judge.</i> I hope, I do hope that is not intended as a threat! My object
is to treat you courteously, and even considerately, but, as I have
already remarked, the Law is, in fact, the Law. Although I represent the
London County Council to a very large extent, still I am a Member of the
Bar, and, by virtue of my office, a gentleman. Under these
circumstances, I shall only be doing my duty&mdash;painful as its performance
may be&mdash;when I sentence you to be kept in penal servitude for seven
years.</p>

at home. "Truly," writes our Puzzled Correspondent, "there is a muddle

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
